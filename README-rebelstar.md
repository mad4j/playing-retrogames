## Setup

### Download ZX Emulator
First of all you need a ZX Spectrum Emulator. Our suggestion is [Speccy](http://fms.komkon.org/Speccy/): very good emulation and available on several platforms (including Android).
Download Speccy and copy/install it on your system.

Other emulators:
* [QAOP](http://torinak.com/qaop/info)
* [JsSpeccy2](https://github.com/gasman/jsspeccy2)

### Download Game Roms
The original game is available in download form [World of Spectrum](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004058). The 1-player mode will be sufficent, but... what about using the 2-player mode by sharing your desktop with an old friend?

### Start the game
* Start Speccy (usually by double-clicking its icon).
* Press **Cancel**, if a File Dialog window is automatically opened.
* Resize the application window, depending on your taste.
* If you are impatient, then rember to select **Hardware -> Fast Tape Loader**; otherwise the loading process happens at the same speed it would happen on a real Spectrum
* Choose **Hardware -> Computer Model -> ZX Spectrum 48kB**

### Save a game
Original game does not support game save. Use the emulator capability to save memory snapshots in order to save your progress.

## Play

The aim of the game for the Raiders is to break into Moonbase
Delta and destroy the core, located at the middle top of the
base.  The aim of the Operatives is to kill all the Raiders. 
Once one of these conditions is fulfilled, the game will end as
soon as the current turn finishes

![Game Map](games/rebelstar/references/Rebelstar%20-%20game%20map.gif)

Move your cursor/unit using the following keys:
```
Q W E
A   D
Z X C
```

To move through the units under your control, you can either
press N to go to the next unit, or simply move the cursor over
the top of them.  Until you actually select a unit, you can move
freely around the map.  Press S to select a unit.

To move a unit, simply press the direction that you want them to
walk in.  Other keys represent other actions.  To attack another
unit, simply walk your own unit into them.

When shooting, the map will change to only show scenery that will
get in the way of the bullets.  You must move the cursor over the
target, and then select the type of shot.  Each has it's own cost
and chance of success.  You will then see the bullets shoot
across the map, and if you are luck, hit the target.

### Tips and Cheats
- The Raiders will receive re-inforcements during the game if
they manage to destroy all of the laser defences.  
- Don't forget that when a unit has died, his weapons can still
be used.
- There are many objects lying around the base that have various
uses.  There are coffee tokens, which can be used in the coffee
machines, and even a lawnmower.
- Only the Rebel robots are able to destroy the airlocks to enter
the base.  They are also required to destroy the core, although
the Photon does also have a small chance of destroying it.
