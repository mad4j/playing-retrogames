## Setup

### Download ZX Emulator
First of all you need a ZX Spectrum Emulator. Our suggestion is [Speccy](http://fms.komkon.org/Speccy/): very good emulation and available on several platforms (including Android).
Download Speccy and copy/install it on your system.

Other emulators:
* [QAOP](http://torinak.com/qaop/info)
* [JsSpeccy2](https://github.com/gasman/jsspeccy2)

### Download Game Roms
The original game is available on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/zx_Atic_Atac_1983_Ultimate_Play_The_Game_a)

### Start the game
* Start Speccy (usually by double-clicking its icon).
* Press **Cancel**, if a File Dialog window is automatically opened.
* Resize the application window, depending on your taste.
* If you are impatient, then rember to select **Hardware -> Fast Tape Loader**; otherwise the loading process happens at the same speed it would happen on a real Spectrum
* Choose **Hardware -> Computer Model -> ZX Spectrum 48kB**

### Save a game
Original game does not support game save. Use the emulator capability to save memory snapshots in order to save your progress.

## Play

If you use Speccy then selec **Kempstone Joystick** on the main screen.
The joystick is emulated using:
* **Cursor keys** - movement
* **ALT** - fire
* **CRTL** - pick object
