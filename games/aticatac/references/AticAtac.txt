I never did believe in Ghosts or Monsters... Not until now, not until the Main
doors of the Castle closed and locked themselves behind me... There's no key
here!!! I'm trapped!!! HELP!!!... HEELLLPPPP!!!!... No-one can hear me... I'm
alone... Why do the doors open and slam shut??!!... Is anybody there??...
HHEELLLLPPPP!!!!... I can see strange shapes materialising on the other side
of the room... Evil eyes glaring at me... Footsteps... Somethings coming down
the corridor... Something large... Something cold... I must run quickly...
QUICKLY... HHEELLLLPPPP!!!!... I must escape before it's too late!!!!!

THE CASTLE
Now that you have been trapped in the evil haunted Castle, your object is to
find the hidden Golden Key of A.C.G. and escape via your only exit, the Main
Doors.
The Castle consists of 5 floors, including the 'Atic' and the caverns, which
contain countless rooms. Within the many rooms you may find furniture, food,
drink, objects, Ghosts, Ghouls and Monsters. Eat and drink sparingly so that
you do not deplete your food supply. Collect and utilise any objects you find
to your best advantage, be wary of slamming doors and working trapdoors which
will try to trap you and avoid contact with all the Ghouls and Monsters, as
each of these will use their best endeavours to hamper your search.

YOUR WARRIOR
Each of the characters, Knight, Surf and Wizard, are armed with their own
specific weapons, individual movement type and use of one set of secret
passages, unbeknown to the others.

GOOD LUCK
